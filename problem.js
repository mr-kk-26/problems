/**
you are given an array A of size N. Your frined gave an amazing task for You

your friend likes one type of sequence. so, he
called that type of sequence a fair sequence.

you should select a fair sequence of maximum length from an array


Here a fair sequence is nothing but you have to select elements in a pattern like positive element
negative element, positive element, .....
(or) negative element positive element, negative element ... to form a sequence
Your task is to print the maximum sum of elements possible by selecting a fair subsequence with maximum
length.

Example : 1

INPUT :

5- N (number of elements in an array)
21 12 13 21 2 --- Array A consists of N elements

OUTPUT
19

EXPLANATION:
Here you can select 21, -1 subsequences of maximum legth 2. The sum is 19 which is the 
maximum possible for a fair subsequence of length 2.
